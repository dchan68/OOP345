Reflection

The difference between internal and external linkage 

from the code

extern unsigned int g_sysClock;

static unsigned COUNTER;

extern identifies external linkage and this is used to refer to an entity that is declared in a scope
from another module/ translation unit. 

Static variables are internal linkages. They can be identified by the keyword static. This is used to 
refere to another entity from within the same module but found in other scopes. 

I also learned how to use argv and argc for the int main as well as using command lines for the debugging feature. 

Changes that I made in upgrading my event class is plentiful. For example, since I had to ensure that the 
description can be a null terminated string of any length, this means we have to allocate dynamic memory.
To do this, I had to make the description into a pointer. On top of that, copy constructor was added.
